				<p>Interested in joining Open Web? Great! We&rsquo;re looking for highly motivated students with various backgrounds, but are primarily developers and designers. We expect all members to have programming experience, unless you&rsquo;re extremely motivated and will learn quickly (we&rsquo;re here to teach you!). The club is open for people with their own app ideas and also students who would like to join one of our existing projects - but not for people who just have an idea and want somebody else to build it for them.</p>
<p>Open Web puts a strong emphasis on community and team building. Youâ€™ll be working intimately with a small group of people that you can learn from, and who will push you to create quality work. We may become as good of friends as we are mentors to each other! Ultimately, we&rsquo;re trying to build a team of the most motivated and talented students on campus to collaborate and create some amazing projects.</p>
<p>The application consists of two parts: an general question form and a casual conversation. If you are interested in learning more, our Spring 2019 general information meeting details will be listed here. If you have further questions, please see the FAQ below or email us at <a href="mailto:openwebbu@bu.edu">openweb@bu.edu</a>!</p>
<h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>
<h3 id="should-i-apply-to-join-open-web">Should I apply to join Open Web?</h3>
<p>If you are passionate about building apps or other tech projects, and enjoy working and learning with a small but dedicated team of people, Open Web is the place for you. We do require members to have at least some programming/coding experience, but more importantly we want members who are eager to learn quickly.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-open-web-application-only">Why is Open Web application-only?</h3>
<p>We want to ensure that Open Web members are strongly motivated to build and learn. Additionally, we want to ensure that members are starting with a baseline skillset to feasibly complete their projects while giving meaningful feedback to others. Open Web is a place where we learn a lot from each other, and so we want new members to be in a position to improve themselves and also teach others. We also value the culture that a small dedicated team has - which like a startup, is quick to move and encourages collaboration.</p>
<h3 id="what-kind-of-projects-are-completed-in-open-web">What kind of projects are completed in Open Web?</h3>
<p>We encourage people to come up with their own ideas and work on projects that they are personally very invested in. However, we have worked in conjunction with local startups, non-profits, and other organizations as well in the past. The majority of club members work on either web or mobile apps individually or in a team, but some members have developed games, built IoT devices, and more.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-time-commitment">What is the time commitment?</h3>
<p>There are two meetings per week. The first is a mandatory general meeting from 8-9:30pm on Monday. The second is a hack night, a dedicated chunk of time during which members can work on their projects. These are Wednesdays from 8-10pm. Between these two meetings and building out your project in your own time, it&rsquo;s likely that you&rsquo;ll spend an average of 10 hours a week or more.</p>
